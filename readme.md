## Random emoji generator

A simple page that generates either a single random emoji, three random emojis, or an incomprehensible emoji "story." Mystify your friends and achieve a legendary status of texting eccentricity.

Emoji are identified by name for educational purposes, which you can easily copy to search for the emojis if needed.

Just to make absolutely sure, randomness is taken from Random.org, so these results are truly random. List of emoji sourced from https://github.com/chalda-pnuzig/emojis.json.
